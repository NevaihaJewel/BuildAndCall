<h1>Building and Calling Functions</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
These Python programs demonstrate the essential concepts of defining, using, and calling functions within a larger script. The first program focuses on creating modular functions that perform specific tasks, while the second program illustrates how to call those functions, pass arguments, and manage the flow of execution. Together, they highlight the importance of modularity, code reusability, and interactive functionality.

<b>Key Features:</b>

- <b>Function Definitions:</b> Includes multiple functions that encapsulate specific tasks, such as arithmetic operations and string manipulations.
- <b>Function Calls:</b> Demonstrates how to invoke defined functions and pass parameters for dynamic computations.
- <b>Arithmetic Operations:</b> Contains functions for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- <b>String Manipulation:</b> Features a function that handles string data types.
- <b>Conditional Logic:</b> Incorporates decision-making within functions using conditionals.
- <b>Input Handling:</b> Uses user input to pass arguments to functions, making the program interactive and adaptable.
- <b>Execution Flow:</b> Exhibits a logical execution order by calling multiple functions based on user inputs, producing dynamic results.

<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>Python IDLE Shell 3.10.2</b>
